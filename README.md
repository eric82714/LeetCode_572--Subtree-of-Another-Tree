# LeetCode_572--Subtree-of-Another-Tree

Given two non-empty binary trees s and t, check whether tree t has exactly the same structure and node values with a subtree of s. A subtree of s is a tree consists of a node in s and all of this node's descendants. The tree s could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

# Example 1:

Given tree s:

Given tree t:

![image](https://github.com/eric82714/LeetCode_572--Subtree-of-Another-Tree/blob/master/image/example-1_2.PNG)

Return true, because t has the same structure and node values with a subtree of s.
 
# Example 2:

Given tree s:
